Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will start with the "entrypoint" code. The entrypoint code is a top-level React component that includes a reference to a child component. 

The goal is to edit the top-level component to pass data to the child component using props.
The data for props should be fetched from the api-path using the fetch API, and stored in a React state variable.

1. Output with no introduction, no explaintation, only code.
1. The first line of code must be 'use client'.
2. Add code to fetch data from the API endpoint using the fetch API and store it in a React state variable.
3. Pass the data to the child component as props.
4. Provide the entire component code as a single, coherent output. No comments or placeholders.
5. The code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Provide a fully functional React component that fetches data from an API endpoint and passes it to a child component as props.
