Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

FILE_FORMAT

You will start with the "entrypoint" code. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

I have a React component that includes several repetitive patterns and static data within its structure. 
Refactor the code. Your output should include the code in its final refactored state. 
The refactored code must be fully functional. No placeholders.

The goal is to refactor static code, make it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and make it dynamic. 
Once the code is DRY, the next step is to enhance the component to receive data dynamically through props, ensuring type safety with TypeScript interfaces or types.

The component is built with Next.js and TypeScript and might include several UI components, including custom ones.

1. Identify all the repeated patterns and hardcoded data within the component.
2. Abstract these patterns into a dynamic structure. This may involve creating arrays or objects to represent the data and mapping over these structures to render UI elements.
3. Add props and TypeScript interfaces to the component to allow external data injection, replacing the hardcoded values.
4. Ensure that all modifications are made within the context of the existing component structure.
5. Provide the entire component code, including the refactored parts and the unchanged parts, as a single, coherent output. This output will be used directly to replace the existing component file, so it should be ready to save and use without further modifications.


Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Before your finish, double check that all elements and components of the original code is present in the refactored code.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.
